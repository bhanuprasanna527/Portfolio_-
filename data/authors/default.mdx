Hi there! I'm Bhanu Prasanna, a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering. During my academic journey, I've done research and extracurricular activities that enriched my experience.

As an aspiring computer scientist, I'm interested in exploring emerging tech and their applications. I've published two papers at IEEE International Conferences on AI and Machine Learning.

Besides research, I'm Vice Chair at PVPSIT ACM Student Chapter. I organize tech events and workshops, developing my leadership and teamwork skills.

Recently, I won 3rd prize at VIT AP National Level Hackathon. This experience taught me about collaboration, critical thinking, and practical problem-solving skills.

I'm highly motivated to learn and explore new possibilities. I aim to contribute to the tech industry and make a positive impact on the world. Onwards and upwards! ðŸš€
