Hello there! My name is Bhanu Prasanna, and I am a final-year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. Over the course of my academic journey, I have actively engaged in research and extracurricular activities that have enriched my overall experience.

As an aspiring computer scientist, I am keenly interested in exploring emerging technologies and their applications. My passion for research has led me to publish two papers at IEEE International Conferences, where I have presented my findings on cutting-edge topics related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

In addition to my research endeavors, I am also a Vice Chair at PVPSIT ACM Student Chapter, where I have contributed to organizing various technical events and workshops for fellow students. Through this role, I gained invaluable leadership skills and a deep appreciation for teamwork.

Recently, I participated in the VIT AP National Level Hackathon and was honored to win the 3rd prize. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration, critical thinking, and practical problem-solving skills.

My passion for learning and exploring new possibilities makes me a highly motivated individual. Using my skills and experience, I hope to make a positive impact on the world and contribute to the tech industry.

From here on out, it's just Onwards and Upwards ðŸš€.
